# Speaker notes

Simple bullet points to prompt me, in case I forget to say something

## Example 0

* Compile example and show result of `objdump -d`
* Point to resource https://www.recurse.com/blog/7-understanding-c-by-learning-assembly
* Discuss function prologue and epilogue, and eax register
* Apply compiler optimisations and show result of objdump

## Example 3

* Discuss compile time of template version compared to run time of recursive version

## Example 5

* Show that the function is essentially the same as the recursive version


## Random asides if I've not touched on them before

* Herb Sutter's talk about utilising the pre-fetcher (https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2014/2-661)
starting at 29:00
* Generally talk about cache levels and how expensive RAM is, e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4087280/approximate-cost-to-access-various-caches-and-main-memory
* Discuss advantages of templatting all algorithms, e.g. for SYCL
* Jason Turner's [Rich Code for Tiny Computers: A Simple Commodore 64 Game in C++17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBkNBP00wJE).
