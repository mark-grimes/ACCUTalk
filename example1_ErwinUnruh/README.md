# example1_ErwinUnruh

This is supposedly the first ever template meta program, written by Erwin Unruh in 1994.
Note that it doesn't actually compile - the prime numbers were printed as part of the error message.

I can't get this to work, but I guess it's heavily reliant on what information the compiler gives
as part of an error message which is not part of the standard.
